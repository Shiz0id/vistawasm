//! Boulders and talus below rock outcrops: their meshes, built at start-up,
//! and where they lie, the CPU twin of `boulder_generate.wgsl`.
//!
//! Every potential boulder is a point on its own world-space lattice, 2 m
//! apart and hashed with its own salt (see `render/lattice.rs`), streamed
//! in 32 m tiles within the boulder distance. A point holds a boulder
//! where its rank is below the probability the soil model's talus field
//! gives (`soil::talus_byte`): 0.35 of the scree there, more at an
//! outcrop's foot. Sizes follow a power law from 0.3 to 3 m, larger the
//! further down the talus cone, as fallen blocks roll furthest. Nothing
//! lies in water, within a drawn channel's half width plus its clearance,
//! off the map, or where the talus field is 0 (sand, glacier, snow, river
//! beds). Each boulder is sunk by 25 to 40 % of its height into the drawn
//! ground and leans with the slope.
//!
//! Streams carry stones of their own, on a second lattice 1 m apart with
//! its own salt, which the same tiles hold: in the water wherever it runs
//! fast, sized by the force of the flow on its bed, a line of cobbles
//! along the wet margin, and a few washed-up blocks on the bank, never
//! more than 1.5 m from the water (see [`stone_at`]). The water shader
//! reads the same lattice, so foam breaks on the stones that are there.
