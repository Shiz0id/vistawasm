//! The channel distance field: the signed distance to the nearest drawn
//! water edge, at four times the heightmap's resolution, so wet margins
//! and river beds follow the drawn banks instead of the heightmap's
//! samples, 12 to 30 m apart.
//!
//! The field is sparse. The map is cut into tiles of [`FIELD_TILE`]
//! texels a side (four heightmap samples), and only tiles within
//! [`FIELD_RANGE_METRES`] of a drawn channel's edge are kept, packed into
//! an atlas the terrain shader reads through a table of slots. Each texel
//! holds two bytes: the signed distance, negative under the water, and
//! the owning channel's speed, whether its banks are rock walls, and the
//! band its loose bed (or rock) covers beside the water. Lakes and plunge pools
//! near a channel are folded in at the heightmap's resolution, so their
//! margins meet the channels' without a seam; elsewhere the wet-bank
//! field still serves them. The terrain shader's twin is
//! `channel_field_at` in `clipmap_render.wgsl`.
