//! The world-space candidate lattice that every tree and grass tuft is
//! placed on, and the rules for thinning it with distance.
//!
//! Every potential tree is a point on a lattice with a 3 m pitch (grass:
//! 0.35 m), jittered by a hash of its integer coordinates. The same hash
//! gives the point a rank `r` in [0, 1): the point is a tree where `r < p`,
//! `p` being the local probability from the cover texture. The far set
//! (built on the CPU) holds the points with `r < p x FAR_KEEP`, and the
//! tiles streamed around the camera by `tree_generate.wgsl` hold the rest,
//! so each point is placed exactly once. `lattice.wgsl` mirrors the hash
//! line for line.
