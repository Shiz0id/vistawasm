//! CPU-baked terrain mesh construction for the GPU renderer.
//!
//! [`build_terrain_mesh`] bakes a single uniform-resolution mesh covering
//! the whole heightmap; it is downsampled so very large terrain still fits
//! comfortably inside WebGPU buffer limits.
//!
//! [`build_terrain_mesh_centred`] implements the engine's LOD strategy: a
//! single regular grid, recentred on the camera each time it drifts far
//! enough, whose sample spacing grows exponentially with distance from the
//! centre (see [`band_sample_offset`]). Because the mesh stays one
//! connected grid (never split into independent tiers or rings), it can
//! never develop the T-junction cracks that classic multi-tier clipmaps
//! need skirts or stitching indices to hide, while still concentrating
//! detail near the camera and reaching far beyond what a uniform mesh of
//! the same vertex count could cover.
