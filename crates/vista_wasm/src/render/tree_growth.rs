//! Tree growth by space colonisation.
//!
//! Every procedural tree is grown when the renderer starts, following
//! Runions, Lane and Prusinkiewicz (2007): attraction points scattered
//! through a species' crown envelope pull the nearest branch node towards
//! them, nodes grow a step towards the points pulling them, and points
//! are used up once a branch reaches them. Branches therefore fill the
//! crown without crossing, leave gaps where the envelope's lobes leave
//! no points, and fork where points pull a node two ways.
//!
//! Radii follow the pipe model: at every fork `r_parent^2.5` is the sum
//! of the children's `r^2.5`, and along a branch each node adds the pipes
//! of the foliage it carries, so limbs taper towards their twigs. The
//! radii are scaled so the trunk at breast height matches the species'
//! trunk radius in `render/flora.rs`, which also sets how wide its roots
//! reach when grounding.
//!
//! Branches are meshed as generalised cylinders along their node paths
//! with parallel-transport frames, and foliage as clump cards at twig
//! tips, textured with the leaf atlas (`shaders/texture_gen.wgsl`). Each
//! vertex carries the data the layered wind in `shaders/trees.wgsl`
//! needs: its branch's pivot, its branch level, its stiffness and a
//! phase.
//!
//! Growth is sequential, so it runs here, in WASM, rather than on the
//! GPU. It is deterministic: a species, variant and age class always grow
//! the same tree.
