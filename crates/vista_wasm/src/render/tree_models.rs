//! Tree species models.
//!
//! Every species is grown when the renderer starts (see
//! `render/tree_growth.rs`): four variants, each in four age classes
//! (young, mature, old and wind-shaped krummholz), and each at two levels
//! of detail, merged into one [`TreeLibrary`]. Fixed seeds mean every run
//! produces byte-identical meshes, so shipping the generator costs a few
//! kilobytes of code instead of megabytes of model data, and there is no
//! per-frame cost: the meshes are uploaded once and drawn instanced.
//!
//! Per-tree variety (size, rotation, colour, lean, variant and age class)
//! comes from instance data. A host's custom model ([`mesh_from_arrays`])
//! replaces every variant of its species.
