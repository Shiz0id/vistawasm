//! Water geometry: the open-ocean grid, rivers, and lakes.
//!
//! The ocean is a fixed, camera-following grid whose vertex spacing grows
//! exponentially with distance (like the terrain mesh), so Gerstner waves
//! can displace real geometry near the camera while one draw still reaches
//! the horizon. The vertex shader moves the grid with the camera, so it is
//! built once and never re-uploaded.
//!
//! Rivers, lakes and waterfalls come from the terrain's own drainage
//! (`terrain/hydrology.rs`), shaped into the heightmap by the channel
//! stage (`terrain/channels.rs`). Here they become geometry: river ribbons
//! whose vertices carry the current, slope, bend and depth; flat lake and
//! oxbow surfaces; and for each waterfall a curved sheet, mist sprites and
//! a plunge pool, in a buffer of their own.
