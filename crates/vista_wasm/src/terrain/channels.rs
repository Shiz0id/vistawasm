//! Channel conditioning: the final river stage.
//!
//! Streams come from [`crate::terrain::hydrology`] and follow the valleys
//! that erosion carved. This stage only shapes their beds and banks:
//!
//! - hydraulic geometry: width and depth grow with discharge;
//! - a water level and bed that never rise downstream, smoothed except
//!   across waterfall steps;
//! - a narrow V in steep ground and a flat-bottomed channel with a
//!   floodplain on gentle ground;
//! - meanders on flat lowland reaches, with the occasional oxbow lake;
//! - deltas where large rivers meet the sea on flat ground;
//! - waterfalls where the bed drops over a step, with a plunge pool.
//!
//! Every changed height is recorded, so the terrain can be restored
//! exactly when river options or the water mask change.
