//! Stage D of fractal generation: hydraulic and thermal erosion at full
//! resolution. This is the CPU reference for the GPU passes in
//! `shaders/hydraulic_erosion.wgsl` and `shaders/thermal_erosion.wgsl`,
//! used by native builds, tests, and as a fallback when the GPU fails.
//!
//! Hydraulic erosion is the virtual-pipe shallow-water model of Mei,
//! Decaudin and Hu (2007). Every iteration runs six passes, each a
//! "gather" that writes only its own cell:
//!
//! 1. Rain, weighted towards cells with a large drainage area, so the
//!    valleys from stream power keep carving.
//! 2. Outflow flux through four virtual pipes, driven by the difference
//!    in water surface height.
//! 3. Water depth and velocity from the fluxes, plus the terrain slope.
//! 4. Erosion and deposition towards the sediment capacity
//!    `C = Kc * sin(slope) * |v| * limit(depth)`. Water that slows where a
//!    valley opens out drops its load, which builds alluvial fans.
//! 5. Sediment advection: each cell's load moves along its velocity and
//!    is split bilinearly between the four cells around where it lands
//!    (a forward semi-Lagrangian step, gathered so it stays race-free).
//!    The split weights sum to one, so advection conserves sediment.
//! 6. Evaporation.
//!
//! The sea and the map edge are sinks: water and sediment that reach them
//! leave the model.
//!
//! Thermal erosion moves material between neighbours whenever the slope
//! between them exceeds the talus angle, in proportion to the excess. The
//! exchange between two cells is computed the same way from either side,
//! so it is race-free and conserves material. It leaves scree slopes at
//! the talus angle below cliffs. A slow linear soil creep between edge
//! neighbours rounds off roughness a sample or two across.
//!
//! Work is split across two scales: 60 % of the iterations run at half
//! resolution, where large features settle cheaply, and the change is
//! upsampled onto the full-resolution map for the remaining 40 %, which
//! form the fine gullies. All heights are in units of the cell size, so
//! the same constants serve both scales.
