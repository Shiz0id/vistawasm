//! Hydrology: where water comes from and where it goes.
//!
//! Water is routed over the finished heightmap (after erosion, glacier
//! shaping and any painted water mask) on a flow grid that is the full
//! heightmap resolution up to [`MAX_GRID`] samples per side. Every cell
//! adds its runoff (precipitation from the climate's moisture, plus
//! snowmelt), which is accumulated downstream as a mean discharge in
//! cubic metres per second. Depressions fill into lakes that overflow at
//! their spill point, or keep their water when evaporation takes all of
//! it. Channels are the cells whose discharge passes a threshold, plus
//! everything downstream of explicit sources: glacier snouts, the lower
//! edge of snow fields, springs at the foot of slopes, and the outlets of
//! lakes fed by a channel.
