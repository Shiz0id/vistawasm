//! Meanders that migrate.
//!
//! A reduced-complexity centreline model (Howard and Knutson, 1984, built
//! on the bend theory of Ikeda, Parker and Sawai, 1981): each point of a
//! river's smooth centreline moves sideways at a rate set by the curvature
//! there and, with a weight that decays downstream, by the curvature
//! upstream. The fast core of the flow is thrown against the outer bank
//! after each bend's apex, so bends grow, skew downstream and migrate;
//! loops tighten until their necks meet, are cut off and leave oxbow lakes.
//! Confinement by the valley walls, uneven bank strength and the channel
//! pattern (meandering gives way to braiding on steep ground) set where
//! and how fast it happens. Everything runs once per river build, on the
//! CPU, from seeded values, so a seed always gives the same rivers.
