//! Soil depth: where bedrock shows through, and where scree lies below it.
//!
//! Rock is not simply steep ground. It shows where the soil is thin:
//! on convex shoulders and ridge crests, on steep slopes that shed their
//! soil, in the frost-shattered ground above the trees, and where a
//! harder layer of the bedrock crosses a slope and stands out as a crag
//! or ledge. Valley floors and footslopes, where water and soil gather,
//! hold the deepest soil. [`soil_field`] estimates the depth once per
//! terrain bake, at heightmap resolution:
//!
//! ```text
//! depth = base - slope_loss - convexity_loss + accumulation - frost - strata
//! ```
//!
//! clamped to 0 to 3 m, and rock shows as the depth falls from 0.6 m to
//! 0.15 m, with a three-sample noise that makes outcrop edges ragged and
//! lobed. Below each outcrop, fallen rock gathers as scree for 2 to 8
//! samples down the steepest descent while the slope stays over 25
//! degrees; where it eases, the talus cone ends. The talus field (scree,
//! and the ground just below each outcrop) tells the boulder generator
//! where fallen blocks lie and how far down their cone they came.
