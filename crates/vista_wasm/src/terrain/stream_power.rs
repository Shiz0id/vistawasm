//! Stage B of fractal generation: stream-power erosion on the coarse grid.
//!
//! The implicit solver of Braun and Willett (2013). Each iteration routes
//! water down the steepest descent (D8), orders cells from the outlets
//! upwards, accumulates drainage area, and lowers every cell towards its
//! receiver at a rate that grows with drainage area. Because the solve is
//! implicit, large time steps stay stable, so a few dozen iterations carve
//! a dendritic valley network with ridge spurs between the valleys.
//! Uplift keeps the ranges standing while they are carved.
//!
//! The time step is long enough that the landscape reaches the steady
//! state where erosion balances uplift within the 40 iterations, so the
//! uplift field decides where the land is high and the drainage network
//! decides its shape. Hillslopes are capped at a threshold slope, as real
//! slopes fail beyond it. Because steady relief is linear in uplift, the
//! result is then rescaled so the highest ground matches the target
//! relief.
//!
//! Glacial carving uses the nonlinear `n = 2` law against the mean height
//! around the receiver, which flattens valley floors and steepens their
//! walls into a U shape. [`plane_valley_floors`] then gives valleys flat
//! floors and over-deepens the largest glacial troughs.
