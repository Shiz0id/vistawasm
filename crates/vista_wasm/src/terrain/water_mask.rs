//! Painted water: a host's mask of rivers and lakes, carved and drawn like
//! the terrain's own.
//!
//! Lakes are flattened into basins below their rim, and above the sea, so
//! the drainage fills them to their lowest rim point and they overflow
//! there into the natural network. Painted water whose rim is at or near
//! the sea is part of the sea instead: it shelves out from the land like a
//! coast. Rivers are thinned to centrelines, stripped of the spurs thinning
//! leaves, traced end to end, turned to run downhill (tributaries into the
//! river they touch), and handed to the channel stage, which cuts them at
//! their painted width (or wider, where their discharge asks for it) and
//! as deep as a natural river of that width, and joins them to the natural
//! network. Every change is recorded, so clearing the mask restores the
//! terrain exactly.
